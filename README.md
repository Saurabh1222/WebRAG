# WebRAG
- Built an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that scrapes real-time web content, splits it into chunks, and stores embeddings using Chroma vector database for context-aware question answering.
- Integrated a free Hugging Face LLM API to generate accurate, concise responses while maintaining modular design using LangChain for document handling and retrieval flow.
